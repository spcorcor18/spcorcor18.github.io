# Stata basics


1.	Interacting with Stata – submit commands via the Command window or menu bar (interactive mode), or through the do-file editor (batch mode).
•	Review, Variables, Properties, and Results windows
•	Paging up/down in the Command window to pull up recent commands
•	Double-clicking commands in the Review window
 
2.	Getting help: syntax

    help
    help keyword
    help regress
    help summarize

3.	"Using Stata as a calculator" (note: sqrt is one of Stata’s many functions.)

	display 2 + 2
	display sqrt(49) + 10

Abbreviations: Stata will accept abbreviated commands. You can use as few letters as you like, so long as the abbreviation remains unique to one command. If you use abbreviations, I recommend using at least as many letters that are needed for others reading your syntax to recognize the command.

di 2 + 2
dis sqrt(49) + 10
