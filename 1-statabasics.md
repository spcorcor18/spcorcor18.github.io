# 1 - Stata basics


1.	Interacting with Stata – submit commands via the Command window or menu bar (interactive mode), or through the do-file editor (batch mode).

* Review, Variables, Properties, and Results windows
* Paging up/down in the Command window to pull up recent commands
* Double-clicking commands in the Review window
 
2.	Getting help: syntax

    help
    help keyword
    help regress
    help summarize

3.	"Using Stata as a calculator" (note: sqrt is one of Stata’s many functions.)

	display 2 + 2
	display sqrt(49) + 10

Abbreviations: Stata will accept abbreviated commands. You can use as few letters as you like, so long as the abbreviation remains unique to one command. If you use abbreviations, I recommend using at least as many letters that are needed for others reading your syntax to recognize the command.

    di 2 + 2
    dis sqrt(49) + 10

Common mathematical operators include +, -, *, and /.  The exponent symbol is ^, for example: di 7^2. For longer expressions, use parentheses to make the intended order of operations clear. For example: di (7+2)*4. Type help functions to see a complete list of functions and operations.

The Expression Builder window is useful for constructing more complicated calculations that make use of operations, functions, saved results, and more. This is found under Data - Other Utilities - Hand Calculator - Create.

You may also use display for text expressions, for example:

    display "hello"
